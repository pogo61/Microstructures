# A Manifesto
# Microstructures and other Velocity Drivers

## Summary
This is the home of the Intellectual Property I have collated \
into a manifesto on how the original aims of DevOps can be achieved. \
I was originally hoping for this to be a book, but unless I bad it out \
with limited code examples, it is too short for that.
While it doesn't introduce any new processes, roles, or structures, it does change responsibilities. \
This changing in responsibilities can be see as very controversial, although I see it as inevitable and logical. \
